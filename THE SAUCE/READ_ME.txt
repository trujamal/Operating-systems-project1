1.) To run the script simply write "sh script.sh" in the command line when in the project folder

If the script says "cp: cannot create regular file ‘data/3-22-006.data’: No such file or directory"
it should still write the data to the results.txt file.

2.) If the script does not work go to "main.py" and comment out everything but the imports above the line
"# If script is not working comment out above and run the code below" and remove the ''' at the bottom of the file

Then simply run "python3 main.py" in the terminal and the data should be written to the file

*** I prefer the second way because the data is formatted better ***
